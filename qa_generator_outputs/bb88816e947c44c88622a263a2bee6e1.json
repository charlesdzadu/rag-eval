            "question": "Why does the Cribl S3 Collector collect all the log files from the S3 bucket every time, instead of only the new ones?",
            "answer": "The Cribl S3 Collector may be collecting all the log files each time because it doesn't have a way to distinguish between old and new files. One solution could be to use a path extractor in the Collector to set a timestamp on the filename. This way, the earliest/latest in your collection job has something to key off and won't need to grab all files.",
            "follow_up_question_1": "How does setting a timestamp on the filename help in distinguishing between old and new files?",
            "follow_up_answer_1": "By setting a timestamp on the filename, you're essentially marking when each file was created. This allows the Collector to identify and collect only the files that were created after its last run, thus avoiding the need to collect all files every time.",
            "follow_up_question_2": "What if the file path is not consistent, can the path extractor still work?",
            "follow_up_answer_2": "The path extractor can still work with inconsistent file paths, but it may require a more complex extractor expression to accurately extract the timestamp. It's important to test the extractor with a variety of file paths to ensure it works correctly.",
            "follow_up_question_3": "Are there any other ways to ensure the Collector only collects new files?",
            "follow_up_answer_3": "Aside from using a path extractor, another approach could be to organize your files in the S3 bucket based on their creation time. For example, you could create separate folders for each day or hour. This way, the Collector can be configured to only collect files from the most recent folders.",

When the file was created? The first event timestamp? If you can provide this info, we can help with a solution. Hello @Brendan Dalpe Thanks for the response.

            "question": "I'm having trouble with the Cribl S3 collector collecting all log files every time it runs. How can I make it collect only new files?",
            "answer": "You can use a path extractor in the Collector to set _time on the filename. This will allow the earliest/latest in your collection job to key off and won't need to grab all files. This is based on the assumption that the file path is consistent.",
            "follow_up_question_1": "Can you explain how this path extractor works?",
            "follow_up_answer_1": "Sure, a path extractor in Cribl allows you to extract specific parts of the file path and assign them to fields. In this case, you can extract the epoch timestamp from the filename and assign it to the _time field. This way, the collector can use this timestamp to determine which files are new and need to be collected.",
            "follow_up_question_2": "What if my file path isn't consistent?",
            "follow_up_answer_2": "If your file path isn't consistent, you might need to adjust the extractor expression to match your specific file path structure. The goal is to accurately extract the timestamp from the filename, so as long as you can do that, the collector should be able to collect only new files.",
            "follow_up_question_3": "Where can I find more information on how to set this up?",
            "follow_up_answer_3": "You can find more detailed information on how to set up path extractors in the Cribl documentation, specifically in the section on S3 collectors. Additionally, the Cribl community is a great resource for getting help from other users and experts.",

S3 bucket contains logs of Akamai datastream which has the log format as below. eg: s3://BUCKETNAME/APPNAME/ENV/ak-913478-1701139960-008071-ds.gz ak- akamai file prefix 913478 - random string 170xxxxxxxx - EPOCH timestamp 008071 - random string ds- file suffix When I schedule the S3 collector to run every 15 minutes, it collects all the log files from buckets every time. Looking for a suggestion, how do I collect only the new files from S3 not all the files every time. Hi @Dinesh Raja, what does the epoch timestamp in the filename represent? When the file was created? The first event timestamp? If you can provide this info, we can help with a solution. Hello @Brendan Dalpe Thanks for the response. Yes, the epoch timestamp represents \"\"file creation time\"\" . @Dinesh Raja, you can use a path extractor in the Collector to set _time on the filename. https://docs.cribl.io/stream/collectors-s3/#path-extractors Something like this should work for you based on this path: s3://BUCKETNAME/APPNAME/ENV/ak-913478-1701139960-008071-ds.gz Path: /${appname}/${env}/${file} Token: file Extractor Expression: {\"\"_time\"\": value.match(/ak-\\d+-(\\d+)-\\w+/)[1]} This is making some assumptions that the file path is consistent, but should help get you going in the right direction. With _time set to the filename, the earliest/latest in your collection job has something to key off and won't need to grab all files. Hope this helps. \u00a9 Cribl 2023 | Legal | Code of Conduct\""
