            "answer": "It appears that the Edge agents aren't connecting to 'https://cdn.cribl.io/telemetry'. If your servers are behind a web proxy, you might need to adjust the proxy settings in Windows. You can try to manually restart the services and the Edge agent.

We are attempting to use the data cloning functionality on our F5 load balancer to duplicate data to our Cribl workers. We want to do this so that we can route, filter, and reduce production data in Cribl without impacting production operations. When the time comes, Cribl will be ready for the cutover without much impact at all, hopefully. Right now, the F5 is sending data to our syslog servers, which then send to Splunk. The end goal is to replace syslog with Cribl, but we want to be able to see all the data in Cribl before then so that we can operate on it. We are successfully cloning data that comes from Splunk UFs and HFs, but the cloned syslog data from the F5 is not being seen by the Cribl worker. The specific problem is this: The data is making it to the to the correct interface and port on the worker, but is not being picked up by Cribl for whatever reason. I have verified that data is coming in by using tcpdump to view the packets. We have turned off the local firewall on the server. There are no iptables rules dropping the traffic. I have verified \"\"net.ipv4.all.rp_filter\"\" is not present in sysctl. I'm not an F5 engineer, so I am mostly looking for feedback from that standpoint. Could the F5 be sending data in the wrong format, if that makes sense? My logic is that if the data is hitting the correct interface/port on the worker, then Cribl should be picking it up, but maybe that logic is flawed. Maybe there is a Linux configuration I am missing. Funny thing is, we can see the UDP port monitoring traffic that the F5 sends to the worker, but not the data that it is cloning and sending. \u00a9 Cribl 2023 | Legal | Code of Conduct\""

We are attempting to use the data cloning functionality on our F5 load balancer to duplicate data to our Cribl workers. We want to do this so that we can route, filter, and reduce production data in Cribl without impacting production operations. When the time comes, Cribl will be ready for the cutover without much impact at all, hopefully. Right now, the F5 is sending data to our syslog servers, which then send to Splunk. The end goal is to replace syslog with Cribl, but we want to be able to see all the data in Cribl before then so that we can operate on it. We are successfully cloning data that comes from Splunk UFs and HFs, but the cloned syslog data from the F5 is not being seen by the Cribl worker. The specific problem is this: The data is making it to the to the correct interface and port on the worker, but is not being picked up by Cribl for whatever reason. I have verified that data is coming in by using tcpdump to view the packets. We have turned off the local firewall on the server. There are no iptables rules dropping the traffic. I have verified \"\"net.ipv4.all.rp_filter\"\" is not present in sysctl. I'm not an F5 engineer, so I am mostly looking for feedback from that standpoint. Could the F5 be sending data in the wrong format, if that makes sense? My logic is that if the data is hitting the correct interface/port on the worker, then Cribl should be picking it up, but maybe that logic is flawed. Maybe there is a Linux configuration I am missing. Funny thing is, we can see the UDP port monitoring traffic that the F5 sends to the worker, but not the data that it is cloning and sending. \u00a9 Cribl 2023 | Legal | Code of Conduct\""

For questions not addressed there, this page outlines how to engage with the Cribl Support staff to resolve problems as quickly as possible. You can contact Cribl Support in multiple ways, outlined below: The best method depends on your reason for contacting Support. For quick, question-and-answer discussions, Community Slack or Cribl\u00c2 Curious might be sufficient. For in-depth discussions, or to troubleshoot technical issues, create\u00c2 a support case for better tracking and exchange of information. You have two options for opening a support case: via email or via the Support Portal (access here, details below). If you exchange diags or other files with us, note that all file-transfer methods except for email are encrypted. Email communication imposes a total message-size limit of 25 MB (after MIME-encoding attachments). The Support Portal allows file attachments of up to 100 MB each. The simplest way to engage with Support is to email support@cribl.io, with the information outlined below.

For questions not addressed there, this page outlines how to engage with the Cribl Support staff to resolve problems as quickly as possible. You can contact Cribl Support in multiple ways, outlined below: The best method depends on your reason for contacting Support. For quick, question-and-answer discussions, Community Slack or Cribl\u00c2 Curious might be sufficient. For in-depth discussions, or to troubleshoot technical issues, create\u00c2 a support case for better tracking and exchange of information. You have two options for opening a support case: via email or via the Support Portal (access here, details below). If you exchange diags or other files with us, note that all file-transfer methods except for email are encrypted. Email communication imposes a total message-size limit of 25 MB (after MIME-encoding attachments). The Support Portal allows file attachments of up to 100 MB each. The simplest way to engage with Support is to email support@cribl.io, with the information outlined below. This will automatically open a case for us to track, and will send you an auto-confirmation email that includes your case number. A Support engineer will then contact you to begin troubleshooting. Within Cribl\u00c2 Stream\u2019s UI, you can click the top-right Support button and, in the resulting Support drawer, select the Get\u00c2 Help upper tab. Then click Email\u00c2 support. This will create a new email to us in your email client. Our Support staff monitors Cribl\u2019s Community Slack for any issues customers are experiencing: https://cribl\u00e2\u0080\u0091community.slack.com/. If you are not already registered for our Community Slack, please register at https://cribl.io/community/ to get started. Slack might not get you the same timely response as an email, but it\u2019s a great way to get questions about Cribl\u00c2 Stream answered by a wide range of Cribl insiders, and expert peer users, who enjoy sharing their knowledge of the product. Check out individual channels dedicated to feature requests, docs, and other concerns. Our Enterprise customers have their own private channels where they can communicate directly with their Cribl account team. Cribl\u00c2 Curious is a threaded community Q&A site. Our\u00c2 support staff monitors it, as do other Cribl teams. As\u00c2 with Community\u00c2 Slack, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best for issues that aren\u2019t critical or urgent. The Cribl Support Portal is available to our licensed customers. It facilitates encrypted transfer of large files, and maintains support cases\u2019 history so that you can easily review them. The Support Portal uses single sign-on (SSO) through an integration with Cribl.Cloud accounts. So as part of Support\u00c2 Portal signup, you\u2019ll receive an invitation to create a Cribl.Cloud account, if you don\u2019t already have one. You\u00c2 have no obligation to use your Cribl.Cloud Organization for purposes other than SSO, if it doesn\u2019t meet your needs. For details about navigating Cribl.Cloud, see the Cribl.Cloud. The Support Portal enables two types of users: Standard and Admin. You can have up to four user logins per customer account, one of which can be (but is not required to be) an Admin user. Standard users can: Admin users can do all of the above, plus: You\u2019ll need to receive a Cribl.Cloud invitation from Cribl or your Support Portal Admin, and follow the directions in the email to sign up.
