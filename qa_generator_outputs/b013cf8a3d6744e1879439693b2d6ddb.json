            "question": "I'm trying to use the data cloning functionality on our F5 load balancer to duplicate data to our Cribl workers. However, the cloned syslog data from the F5 is not being seen by the Cribl worker. What could be the problem?",
            "answer": "There could be several reasons why the cloned syslog data from the F5 is not being seen by the Cribl worker. It could be that the data is not being sent in the correct format, or there could be a Linux configuration that you're missing. You can verify if the data is coming in by using tcpdump to view the packets. Also, ensure that the local firewall on the server is turned off and that there are no iptables rules dropping the traffic.",
            "follow_up_question_1": "I've verified that the data is coming in and that the local firewall is turned off. Could the issue be with the format in which the F5 is sending the data?",
            "follow_up_answer_1": "Yes, it's possible that the F5 could be sending data in a format that the Cribl worker is not able to recognize. You might need to check with an F5 engineer to ensure that the data is being sent in a format that the Cribl worker can process.",
            "follow_up_question_2": "I see. And what about the Linux configuration? Could there be something I'm missing there?",
            "follow_up_answer_2": "Yes, there could be a Linux configuration that you're missing. For instance, you need to ensure that 'net.ipv4.all.rp_filter' is not present in sysctl. If it is, it could be preventing the Cribl worker from picking up the data.",
            "follow_up_question_3": "What if I've checked all these things and the Cribl worker still isn't picking up the data?",
            "follow_up_answer_3": "If you've checked all these things and the Cribl worker still isn't picking up the data, it might be due to some other issue. It's recommended to reach out to the Cribl support team with the details of your issue for further assistance.",

They are routing events to an on-premise Cribl Stream instance. Everything was working fine, until collection just stopped. It appears that the Edge agents aren't connecting to \"\"https://cdn.cribl.io/telemetry\"\". These servers are behind a web proxy. The proxy settings are applied properly in Windows. If I pull up a browser on the server, and surf to https://cdn.cribl.io/telemetry, I get the expected output --- \u201ccribl /// living the stream!\u201d I have tried: I have manually restarted the services and the Edge agent itself multiple times. Nothing has worked. What is the proper combination of settings in Windows and Cribl Edge to force the agent to use the proxy to phone home? Try this PowerShell please: Please change your proxy URLs to the correct values. This will set the environment variables on the Cribl Edge service. Try this PowerShell please: Please change your proxy URLs to the correct values. This will set the environment variables on the Cribl Edge service. This worked properly, and it DOES persist across reboots. Problem solved. Thank you Brendan! Excellent! I don't know about persisting through upgrades, so let us know if/when you do that what happens. Whoopsie\u2026follow-up\u2026. Two things: (1) The Powershell changes do NOT PERSIST across upgrades. After the bump from 4.4.0 to 4.4.3, I had to run them again. The output of \"\"Get-ItemProperty HKLM:SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Cribl -Name Environment\"\" was blank. Re-running the Powershell restored them. (2) Separate Issue: BEFORE the upgrade, the Powershell environment variables worked\u2026until they didn't. Everything was still set properly, as configured by the previous commands. However, the Edge agents started failing Telemetry checks again at some point, despite the fact that the Environment variables were set properly at the time. Everything flat-lined except the regular system stats/processes/etc. POST-upgrade, even after applying the environment variables and restarting the Cribl agents (both from the Leader node and the local Windows service), there is still no event flow. Do subsequent telemetry attempts fail to use the proxy? Is there a way to FORCE the Edge clients to try and reconnect again? A good old-fashioned kick? I'm not sure what's going on in the background. \u00a9 Cribl 2023 | Legal | Code of Conduct\"\n\nDistant reference chunk: url,title,text_chunks https://community.cribl.io/discussion/777/data-cloned-on-f5-and-sent-to-cribl-workers,Data cloned on F5 and sent to Cribl workers \u2014 Curious + Community,\"Posting this to get community feedback and track our progress in case anyone encounters this issue in the future. We are attempting to use the data cloning functionality on our F5 load balancer to duplicate data to our Cribl workers. We want to do this so that we can route, filter, and reduce production data in Cribl without impacting production operations. When the time comes, Cribl will be ready for the cutover without much impact at all, hopefully. Right now, the F5 is sending data to our syslog servers, which then send to Splunk. The end goal is to replace syslog with Cribl, but we want to be able to see all the data in Cribl before then so that we can operate on it. We are successfully cloning data that comes from Splunk UFs and HFs, but the cloned syslog data from the F5 is not being seen by the Cribl worker. The specific problem is this: The data is making it to the to the correct interface and port on the worker, but is not being picked up by Cribl for whatever reason. I have verified that data is coming in by using tcpdump to view the packets. We have turned off the local firewall on the server. There are no iptables rules dropping the traffic. I have verified \"\"net.ipv4.all.rp_filter\"\" is not present in sysctl. I'm not an F5 engineer, so I am mostly looking for feedback from that standpoint. Could the F5 be sending data in the wrong format, if that makes sense? My logic is that if the data is hitting the correct interface/port on the worker, then Cribl should be picking it up, but maybe that logic is flawed. Maybe there is a Linux configuration I am missing. Funny thing is, we can see the UDP port monitoring traffic that the F5 sends to the worker, but not the data that it is cloning and sending. \u00a9 Cribl 2023 | Legal | Code of Conduct\""

For questions not addressed there, this page outlines how to engage with the Cribl Support staff to resolve problems as quickly as possible. You can contact Cribl Support in multiple ways, outlined below: The best method depends on your reason for contacting Support. For quick, question-and-answer discussions, Community Slack or Cribl\u00c2 Curious might be sufficient. For in-depth discussions, or to troubleshoot technical issues, create\u00c2 a support case for better tracking and exchange of information. You have two options for opening a support case: via email or via the Support Portal (access here, details below). If you exchange diags or other files with us, note that all file-transfer methods except for email are encrypted. Email communication imposes a total message-size limit of 25 MB (after MIME-encoding attachments). The Support Portal allows file attachments of up to 100 MB each. The simplest way to engage with Support is to email support@cribl.io, with the information outlined below. This will automatically open a case for us to track, and will send you an auto-confirmation email that includes your case number. A Support engineer will then contact you to begin troubleshooting. Within Cribl\u00c2 Stream\u2019s UI, you can click the top-right Support button and, in the resulting Support drawer, select the Get\u00c2 Help upper tab. Then click Email\u00c2 support. This will create a new email to us in your email client. Our Support staff monitors Cribl\u2019s Community Slack for any issues customers are experiencing: https://cribl\u00e2\u0080\u0091community.slack.com/. If you are not already registered for our Community Slack, please register at https://cribl.io/community/ to get started. Slack might not get you the same timely response as an email, but it\u2019s a great way to get questions about Cribl\u00c2 Stream answered by a wide range of Cribl insiders, and expert peer users, who enjoy sharing their knowledge of the product. Check out individual channels dedicated to feature requests, docs, and other concerns. Our Enterprise customers have their own private channels where they can communicate directly with their Cribl account team. Cribl\u00c2 Curious is a threaded community Q&A site. Our\u00c2 support staff monitors it, as do other Cribl teams. As\u00c2 with Community\u00c2 Slack, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best for issues that aren\u2019t critical or urgent. The Cribl Support Portal is available to our licensed customers. It facilitates encrypted transfer of large files, and maintains support cases\u2019 history so that you can easily review them. The Support Portal uses single sign-on (SSO) through an integration with Cribl.Cloud accounts. So as part of Support\u00c2 Portal signup, you\u2019ll receive an invitation to create a Cribl.Cloud account, if you don\u2019t already have one. You\u00c2 have no obligation to use your Cribl.Cloud Organization for purposes other than SSO, if it doesn\u2019t meet your needs. For details about navigating Cribl.Cloud, see the Cribl.Cloud. The Support Portal enables two types of users: Standard and Admin. You can have up to four user logins per customer account, one of which can be (but is not required to be) an Admin user. Standard users can: Admin users can do all of the above, plus: You\u2019ll need to receive a Cribl.Cloud invitation from Cribl or your Support Portal Admin, and follow the directions in the email to sign up. Both scenarios are summarized below. But first, a word from our sponsor, us: This video walks you through signing up for the Support\u00c2 Portal, and then submitting cases with enough detail for Cribl\u00c2 Support to rapidly help you. Accessing the Cribl Support Portal To access the Cribl Support Portal if you already have a Cribl.Cloud account: To access the Cribl Support Portal without an existing Cribl.Cloud account: To access the Cribl Support Portal as an Admin user: Contact Cribl Support to request Admin access. If your customer account already has an Admin user, the current Admin must also contact Cribl, requesting to transfer the account\u2019s sole Admin user role to you.The request from the current Portal Admin must originate from the email address we have on file for that Admin user. We can tell you who the current Admin is, if you do not know. If you have an existing Cribl.Cloud account, then Cribl Support will promote your account to Admin.If you do not yet have a Cribl.Cloud account, Cribl\u00c2 Support will email you a Support\u00c2 Portal signup invitation. Follow the link in the email to accept the invitation, using the same email address at which you received the invitation. All support cases must be submitted by an individual account (not a shared or group account). However, there are broader notification options. When you create a new case, note the two fields for Related Teammates. Each name entered here must be an existing Contact on your customer account. If you want to enter one of your own organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s group email addresses, contact Cribl Support to create a contact entry for that address.

For instructions on how to pull a diag file, see Diagnosing\u00c2 Issues. With Cribl\u00c2 Stream (LogStream) 2.4.1 or later, and Cribl Edge, the diag is uploaded from the browser, rather than from the Node. This means that your Worker\u00c2 Nodes do not need internet access. With LogStream 2.4.0 or earlier, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to transfer the diags from your Worker Nodes. Diag bundles for Leader Nodes do not include diag bundles for any Worker\u00c2 Nodes. If you would like to upload your diag file via the GUI or CLI, you\u2019ll need outbound internet access to the upload URL (https://diag-upload.cribl.io), plus a valid support case number (provided in your case confirmation email). If your organization does not permit outbound access to https://diag-upload.cribl.io to upload from within Cribl\u00c2 Stream, you can also submit diags directly via the Support Portal (login required).

            "question": "What is Cribl Stream and how does it benefit a user?",
            "answer": "Cribl Stream is an observability pipeline that offers flexibility in collecting, reducing, enriching, normalizing, and routing data from any source to any destination within your existing data infrastructure. It's vendor-agnostic, meaning it can work with any data source or destination. This flexibility can lead to more comprehensive and effective data analysis and insights.",
            "follow_up_question_1": "What does it mean for Cribl Stream to be 'vendor-agnostic'?",
            "follow_up_answer_1": "Being 'vendor-agnostic' means that Cribl Stream is not tied to any specific vendor or technology. It can collect and route data from any source to any destination, regardless of the technology or vendor involved. This gives users the freedom to choose the best tools for their needs without worrying about compatibility issues.",
            "follow_up_question_2": "What other products does Cribl offer?",
            "follow_up_answer_2": "In addition to Stream, Cribl offers Cribl Edge, an intelligent, highly scalable edge-based data collection system for logs, metrics, and application data. They also offer Cribl Search, which allows users to search data in place without having to collect/store first. Lastly, they have the Cribl.Cloud platform, which provides a fast and easy way to realize the value of an observability ecosystem without the hassle of running infrastructure.",
            "follow_up_question_3": "How does Cribl Search turn the traditional search process on its head?",
            "follow_up_answer_3": "Traditional search processes often involve collecting and storing data before it can be searched. Cribl Search, on the other hand, allows users to search data in place, without the need for prior collection or storage. This can save significant time and resources, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.",

            "follow_up_question_1": "How does searching data in place work and what are its advantages?",

This can significantly reduce storage costs and the time it takes to get results. It also means you can search across all your data, not just the data you've chosen to collect and store.",
